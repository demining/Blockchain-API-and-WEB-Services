<p><a href="https://github.com/smartiden/Bitcoin-Integration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>, as a cryptocurrency, offers many benefits such as decentralization, security and anonymity. However, when it comes to sharing your Bitcoin address, there are certain privacy and security risks. To solve this problem, it is suggested to use One-Time Address. We’ll look at what a One-Time Address is, how it works, and why it’s the best way to share your Bitcoin address. In the world of cryptocurrencies, security and privacy are key aspects for any user. One way to improve security is to use disposable addresses to receive bitcoins. In this article, we’ll look at what disposable addresses are and why they are a more secure way to share your Bitcoin address.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the new and improved way to share your Bitcoin address using disposable addresses. A one-time address is unique and temporary, which provides additional security and anonymity when conducting cryptocurrency transactions. Learn more about the benefits of using disposable addresses and how they can help strengthen the security of your Bitcoin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is One-Time Address?</h2>



<p>One-Time Address (OTA) is a Bitcoin address that can only be used once to receive a transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, the address is no longer valid and cannot be reused. This ensures that only the sender and recipient know who exactly made the transaction and prevents transactions from being traced across the blockchain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does One-Time Address work?</h2>



<p>When creating a Bitcoin wallet, the system automatically generates several One-Time Addresses. Every time you want to receive a transaction, the wallet will provide you with a new, unique address. This means that every time someone sends you bitcoins, they will be sent to a new address, making it nearly impossible to track transactions across the blockchain.</p>



<p>Once the transaction is confirmed, the One-Time Address is no longer valid and cannot be reused. This ensures that your information and transaction history remains private and secure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why One-Time Address is the best way to share your Bitcoin address?</h2>



<ol>
<li>Privacy: Using One-Time Address ensures that your information and transaction history remain confidential. No one can track your transactions on the blockchain since each transaction occurs at a unique address.</li>



<li>Security: Using One-Time Address also increases the security of your Bitcoin wallet. If hackers gain access to your Bitcoin address, they can track all your transactions and steal your Bitcoins. However, if you use a One-Time Address, hackers will only have access to one transaction associated with that address.</li>



<li>Convenience: One-Time Address is easy to create and use. Most Bitcoin wallets automatically generate One-Time Addresses when they receive transactions, making the process of sharing your Bitcoin address simple and convenient.</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Python script that prints a new One-Time Address for each call:</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import random
import hashlib
import binascii

def generate_ota(domain: str, timestamp: int) -&gt; str:
    #Generate a random nonce
    nonce = random.randint(1, 1000000)

    #Calculate the hash of the domain and nonce
    hash = hashlib.sha256(f"{domain}{nonce}").hexdigest()

    #Encode the hash in base58
    ot = binascii.hexlify(hash).decode("utf-8")

    #Append the timestamp to the OT
    ot += f"{timestamp:010d}"

    return ot

#Example usage
domain = "example.com"
timestamp = int(time.time())
ota = generate_ota(domain, timestamp)
print(ota)</code></pre>



<p>This script uses the&nbsp;<code>hashlib</code>&nbsp;library to generate a SHA-256 hash of the domain and a random nonce, and then encodes the hash in base58 using&nbsp;<code>binascii.hexlify()</code>. It then appends the timestamp to the end of the OT in the format “YYMMDD”, where YY is the year, MM is the month (padded with leading zeros), and DD is the day (also padded with leading zeros).</p>



<p>You can call the&nbsp;<code>generate_ota()</code>&nbsp;function with a domain and timestamp as arguments to generate a new OT. For example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>domain = "example.com"
timestamp = int(time.time())
ota = generate_ota(domain, timestamp)
print(ota)</code></pre>



<p>This will output a new One-Time Address for the given domain and timestamp.</p>



<p>Please note that this is a very basic implementation of One-Time Address and it’s not recommended to use it for real-world applications without proper testing, security audits and maintenance.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An example of creating a one-time address using&nbsp;<code>pycoin</code>:</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>from pycoin.key import Key
from pycoin.networks import networks

# Создание ключа
network = networks["bitcoin"]
secret_exponent = Key.from_random()
public_pair = secret_exponent.public_pair()
public_key = public_pair.format(network=network)

# Создание одноразового адреса
address = public_key.to_address(network=network)

print("Одноразовое bitcoin адрес:", address)</code></pre>



<p>This code will create a random private key value (secret exponent) and then use it to obtain a public key value (public key), which in turn is converted to a unique bitcoin address. Please note that this address will be unique and cannot be reused.</p>



<p>It is important to remember that to use one-time addresses in the real world, you will need to integrate it with the “One-Time Address” service or implement your own system for generating and storing these addresses and their connections with requests for payment or sending funds.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<p>To create a simple script to monitor bitcoins in a wallet and send notifications about a price change or event on the blockchain, we can use the library&nbsp;<code>ccxt</code>to access the API of cryptocurrency exchanges and&nbsp;<code>python-telegram-bot</code>send notifications via Telegram. Make sure you have installed these libraries using&nbsp;<code>pip</code>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pip install ccxt python-telegram-bot</code></pre>



<p>Then create a file&nbsp;<code>alerting_script.py</code>and copy the following code:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import ccxt
import time
from telegram.ext import Updater, MessageHandler, Filters
import os

# Telegram bot credentials
TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
CHAT_ID = 'YOUR_CHAT_ID'  # Текущий или групповой ID

# Криптовалютная биржа (например, Binance)
exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'apiKey': 'YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY',
    'secret': 'YOUR_BINANCE_API_SECRET',
})

# Котировки, которые вы хотите мониторить (например, BTC/USD)
currency_pair = 'BTC/USDT'

# Метод, который проверяет котировки и отправляет уведомления
def check_price(update, context):
    try:
        ticker = exchange.fetch_ticker(currency_pair)
        current_price = ticker['last']

        # Функция для отправки уведомления
        def send_alert(text):
            context.bot.send_message(chat_id=CHAT_ID, text=text)

        # Условие для отправки уведомления, например, если цена достигает某个阈值
        if current_price &gt; 50000:  # Обновите этот уровень, если нужна другая граница
            send_alert(f"Price of {currency_pair} has crossed the threshold of $50,000!")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

# Инициализация Telegram бота
updater = Updater(token=TOKEN, use_context=True)
dispatcher = updater.dispatcher
price_handler = MessageHandler(Filters.command, check_price)
dispatcher.add_handler(price_handler)

# Запуск мониторинга каждые 5 минут
while True:
    check_price(None, None)
    time.sleep(300)  # Мониторинг каждые 5 минут

# Запуск бота
updater.start_polling()
updater.idle()</code></pre>



<p>Replace&nbsp;<code>'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'</code>with&nbsp;<code>'YOUR_CHAT_ID'</code>your own Telegram bot and chat values, respectively, and&nbsp;<code>'YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY'</code>with&nbsp;<code>'YOUR_BINANCE_API_SECRET'</code>your API keys and Binance secret key.</p>



<p>Please note that this script only checks the price for Binance and has a simple condition for sending notifications. To change the exchange or clarify various conditions, you need to change the code in the function&nbsp;<code>check_price()</code>.</p>



<p>You can customize this script to send notifications for other events or events on the blockchain using the appropriate cryptocurrency exchange API functions.</p>
